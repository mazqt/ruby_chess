This is the final Ruby project in The Odin Project curriculum, a fully functioning terminal-version of the game chess.

For this project, I am aiming to use TDD to implement the game efficiently and catch problems and faulty functions without having to rely on manual testing.
This will also prove to be quite a challenge in that I have to research and figure out ways to implement a somewhat complex game without any handholding or major help from the curriculum.
I'm aiming to use this as a chance to strengthen the habit of breaking up functions when I can, something which I've struggled with implementing before due to not thinking about it until after I end up with excessively large ones. 
As for testing, it's a lot of experience and reinforcement of that as well. I'm going to mainly use rather simple testing methods as I am still not fully comfortable with stubbing and the like.
